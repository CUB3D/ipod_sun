These are some tools I built as part of my iPod research, they probably aren't useful for anyone but are here for those who are interested:

wtf_efi_fuzzer: fuzzing for sign bypasses
patch_payload: (I think) Patches for a log writing function to dump heap state to a file, used to debug a unfinished heap exploit
test_payload_in_osos: Emulator for the N5G freetype code, for developing the ipod_sun exploit
osos_patcher: actual tool for injecting patch_payload?
n6g_dumper: Tool for dumping the ram of the n6g over usb descriptors
gib_cert: Tool for unpacking img1s

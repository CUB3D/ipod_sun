These are some tools I built as part of my iPod research, they probably aren't useful for anyone but are here for those who are interested:

wtf\_efi\_fuzzer: fuzzing for sign bypasses

patch\_payload: (I think) Patches for a log writing function to dump heap state to a file, used to debug a unfinished heap exploit

test\_payload\_in\_osos: Emulator for the N5G freetype code, for developing the ipod\_sun exploit

osos\_patcher: actual tool for injecting patch\_payload?

n6g\_dumper: Tool for dumping the ram of the n6g over usb descriptors

gib\_cert: Tool for unpacking img1s
